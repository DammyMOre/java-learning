We use selection statements to choose among alternative courses of action.
if statement either performs (selects) an action, if a condition is true, or skips it, if the condition is false.

while;

A while iteration statement allows you to specify that a program should repeat an action while
some condition remains true.

similarities
They both performs an action when the conditions are true.

Differences
1. The if single selection statement performs a single action, while the while iteration statement can perform repetitive
actions.(i.e) it can iterate.
